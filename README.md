### Application Features

#### Core Features

- [x] User can view a list of current movies from The Movie Database API as a grid view
  - The grid element should have an id of `movies-grid`
  - Each movie wrapper element should have a class of `movie-card`
- [x] For each movie displayed, user can see the following details:
  - Title - the element should have a class of `movie-title`
  - Image - the `img` element should have a class of `movie-poster`
  - Votes - the element should have a class of `movie-votes`
- [x] User can load more current movies by clicking a button at the bottom of the list
  - The button should have an id of `load-more-movies-btn`.
  - When clicked, the page should not refresh.
  - New movies should simply be added to the bottom
- [x] Allow users to search for movies and display them in a grid view
  - There should be a search input element with an id of `search-input`
  - Users should be able to type into the input
  - When a user hits 'Enter', it should send a search request to the movies API
  - The results from the search should be displayed on the page
  - There should be a close icon with an id of `close-search-btn` that exits the search, clears results, and shows the current movies displayed previously
- [x] Website accounts for basic HTML/CSS accessibility features
- [x] Website should be responsive

#### Stretch Features

- [x] Deploy website using GitHub Pages.
- [x] Allow user to view more details about a movie within a popup.
- [x] Improve the user experience through CSS & animation.
- [ ] Allow movie video trailers to be played using [embedded YouTube](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780?hl=en)
- [x] Implement anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Add your response here:

"The topics gave me an overview of the course content and tools for project execution but my preparedness was not fully determined by the discussions in the labs. I needed extra time to Understand API implementation based on documentation and know how to write code blocks for event listeners, which I later read up and understood spending more hours studying them before starting the project"

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Add your response here:

"Honestly, I may not have done it better. This is because I was challenged to catch up to pace and adjust to the working environment. So I may have stretched the progress across the "extra time" if i already knew there was more time instead of the timeframe given. I will have a better understanding but my implementation and project execution may have been slower. So challenging myself bypassed that, with all the questions and queries I had for the TAs and Instructor."

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Add your response here:

"I had difficulty with updating the results displayed from clicking 'load more' after I have searched a keyword and I also had problem with the functionality, knowing where to call what to not mess the urls and outputs up.  So staying behind and texting my peers and explaining my code, along with some self research helped to identify bugs and I am happy that it went the way I wanted it to-- using cards to contain each movie in a grid and updating the results based on "search" and "close" buttons

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

  *Shout out to Folusho Adeyemi, Nnnuji-John Okechukwu for helping me idemtify bugs, Tim Lee and Diogo Botelho for helping me understand concepts and the deeper WHYs and Lee Fu (my intern manager) for tips on efficiency

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.
